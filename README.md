# MarketingOptimizer-AI Case Study

## Overview

**MarketingOptimizer-AI** is an intelligent system designed to evaluate social media campaign performance and provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing ad spend. Its main goal is to help marketing teams make informed decisions by automatically validating input data, calculating key performance metrics, and suggesting budget adjustments for each marketing channel. The system is built to be accessible even to non-technical users, presenting every step in clear, simple language with detailed explanations and easy-to-follow formulas.

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system rigorously checks that input data is:
  - Provided in the correct file format (CSV or JSON within markdown code blocks)
  - Written in English
  - Complete with all required fields: `channel`, `sales_conversion`, `click_through_rate`, `customer_retention`, and `ad_spend`
  - Of the proper data type with numeric values where needed and within expected ranges

- **Performance Calculation:**  
  It computes a **Performance Score** for each campaign using the formula:
  $$
  \text{Performance Score} = (\text{sales\_conversion} \times 0.4) + (\text{click\_through\_rate} \times 0.3) + (\text{customer\_retention} \times 0.3)
  $$
  Every step of the calculation is explained using clear LaTeX formulas and rounded values, making it easy for anyone to understand.

- **Performance Categorization:**  
  Based on the calculated score, campaigns are categorized as:
  - **High Performance:** Score $\geq 0.50$
  - **Low Performance:** Score $< 0.30$
  - **Moderate Performance:** Scores in between

- **Budget Allocation Recommendation:**  
  Depending on the performance category and current ad spend, the system suggests:
  - **For High Performance:**  
    - If ad spend is low (≤ \$10,000): *"Increase investment for this channel."*  
    - If ad spend is high (>\$10,000): *"Maintain current investment; channel is performing well with significant spending."*
  - **For Low Performance:**  
    - If ad spend is high (>\$15,000): *"Decrease investment for this channel."*  
    - If ad spend is low (≤ \$15,000): *"Monitor performance; consider reducing investment if performance does not improve."*
  - **For Moderate Performance:**  
    - *"Maintain or slightly adjust the current investment based on further review."*

- **Adaptive Greeting Protocol:**  
  The system responds to user greetings with tailored messages based on tone and urgency. Whether the user is excited, frustrated, or in a hurry, MarketingOptimizer-AI adjusts its greeting to set the right tone for collaboration.

- **Iterative Feedback:**  
  After delivering an analysis, the system invites user feedback (on a scale of 1 to 5) and responds with personalized messages to ensure continuous improvement.
